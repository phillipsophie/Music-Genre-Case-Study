# Music Genre Case Study
#### A DS 4002 Case Study by Sophie Phillips
## Hook & Rubric Documents
- **To be read first:** The file 'CS3_Hook' introduces and outlines the case study. 
- The rubric named 'CS3_Rubric' outlines the formatting, submission requirements, and final deliverables for this assignment.
Both documents should be referenced continously throughout your completion of the case study to guarantee success on the assignment.
## Data
The music data can be obtained from the DATA folder, which contains two tables - one for albums, and one with directions to download the tracks file since it is too large to house on this site. 
## Examples
The 'Examples' folder contains a couple scripts for EDA and Analysis if you need help or ideas when getting started.
## Reference Materials
The 'Reference Materials' folder contains helpful resources related to the context of the social issue and tips for time-series analysis with the Prophet model in developing a predictive model.
